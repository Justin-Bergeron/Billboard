This Project Contains two Python notebooks. 
The first scrapes the top ten songs from the Billboard hot 100 for each week from about 1960 to present day and 
collects enough of the Metadata to make an API call to Spotify.
The Spotify API Call uses the scraped metadata to add additional information from the Spotify API to JSON file.
The complete JSON file is also included. It ended up with about 36000 songs from 1960-2018. And the metadata includes:
